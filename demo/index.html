          <h2>Game PLay</h2>
          <p>Build-A-Battle’s gameplay consists of two phases: the Placement Phase, during which the playable level is crafted from randomly generated tiles; and the Play Phase, during which the player controls a 3D character and battles enemies throughout the level they created.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="column" >
          <h2>Art Style and Theme</h2>
          <p>The game is going to have a cyberpunk/futuristic theme akin to movies like Robocop or Blade runner, Characterized by dark, grimy streets, lots of neon, holograms, etc. The art style will compose of a semi real and semi animated style. It will be set in an isometric world view. With that in mind it will be implemented  a 3d environment. Both the models and environment will be sculpted with Zbrush and Maya.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="column" >
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>we have several ideas that we might warrant testing once we have a working prototype. One of such idea is that, after a set number of rounds, the game ends and the player with the higher score is declared the winner. The score would be determined by the total gold and experience accumulated by each player throughout the game.
                  Another idea floating around the team is to have a final player-versus-player round. During the Play phase of the final round, the players would brawl in a battle royale using the characters they’ve molded over the course of the previous rounds.</p>

                        <p>When the game starts out you are looking at a grid, in the center is a simple 1x1 room. This room is where you will start out at. Below that room will be a large 3x3 room that is completely open and only has one door facing the default room. This is the bosses room. </p>
                        
                        <p>Your hand will be displayed at the bottom of the screen and will consist of seven room tiles of various sizes and layouts starting from a 1x1 room all the way up to a 3x3 room. Each of these room tiles will have openings along the walls, these are the doors. You can place a room tile down on the grid given a few constraints. The new tile must match up with at least one existing door and the new tile cannot overlap any previously placed tiles. </p>

                        <p>Once a room tile is placed you will automatically draw another room tile to fill that spot. The deck holds 50 rooms in total and you can keep placing rooms until you run out of open doors or you have placed all 50 rooms. Once that happens, or at any time before that if you want, you can press “Switch to play” to spawn in to the map created from your tile placements.</p>
